Created for a personal issue of not being able to properly download my Spotify playlists.
Downloads song with all metadata, including
Album art
Lyrics (scraped either from AZlyrics or Google, depeding whether you've been already blocked by AZlyrics)
Album name
Artist
Title
Date published

Usage:
run main.py (no need to use the obsolete folder, delete it) with a CSV created by the amazing https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/ (yes, you could objectively also automate this), adjust the encoding in the Pandas assignment accordingly and go

exportify is quite useful in the way that you can even download your private playlists (as login is needed)
