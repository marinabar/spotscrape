Created for a personal issue of not being able to properly download my Spotify playlists (needs pytube package).

Downloads song with all metadata, including
Album art
Lyrics (scraped either from AZlyrics or Google, depending on whether you've been blocked already by AZlyrics)
Album name
Artist
Title
Date published

Usage:
run main.py with a CSV created by the amazing https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/ (yes, you could objectively also automate this as well)

exportify is quite useful as you can even export your private playlists (your login is needed)
